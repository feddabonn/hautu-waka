      "content": "Some situations can be analysed and solved. Others resist that approach — policy design where stakeholders shift positions, organisational change where each adaptation changes the terrain, any environment where what worked last month stops working. These aren't problems to solve. They're conditions to find your way through."

      "heading": "How it works",
      "content": "The diagram shows six stages/states. You can move through them as a linear design process, and that works. But the real power is in treating them as states you move between as conditions require — sometimes progressing, sometimes cycling back, sometimes finding that your destination changes mid-journey. Polynesian navigators didn't use fixed maps because the ocean doesn't hold still. This framework applies that principle to complex contemporary work."
